# Ray Tracer Challenge
![test_banner](https://github.com/agentbellnorm/ray-tracer-challenge/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

This is a ray tracer written in Rust following the book ["The ray tracer challenge" by Jamis Buck](http://raytracerchallenge.com/). 

The book provides language agnostic test cases, pseudocode and explanations. The rest is up to the reader to implement.
### What is ray tracing?
Ray tracing is a technique for rendering digital images by simulating how light behaves as it interacts with different materials. It produces realistic results but is relatively slow.
